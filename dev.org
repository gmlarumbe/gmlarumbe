* verilog-ext
** TODO verilog-ext: Use a :vhier-files that overrides :files for cases where there are TB files decoupled from the RTL!?
- Or something like that
- [ ] Depends on whether vhier can handle complex class-based SV files or it reports syntax errors due to lack of support

** DONE Dev: Do equivalent to AUTOs to be able to do instantiations
CLOSED: [2025-07-20 Sun 17:22]
- [ ] Worked around by switching temporarily to `verilog-mode` before running `verilog-auto`, then switching back to `verilog-ts-mode`
- Check code on TerosHDL and their API to see how they get info about the ports
- [ ] template: syntax-ppss error with instance from file in `verilog-ts-mode', with `verilog-mode' works fine
  - This is because `verilog-auto' changes mode to `verilog-mode' and the `syntax-ppss' changes, and is somehow wrong...
  - [ ] It would be needed to use a replacement of Verilog_AUTO approach with tree-sitter:
    - Use tree-sitter parsing to get the ports, their type, and their names and save them in some variable
    - Use this variable to generate the instantiation

** DONE verilog-ts-mode: template instance from file implementation
CLOSED: [2025-07-20 Sun 17:23]
- To overcome the syntax-ppss error after verilog-auto
- Probably needs to use something different as verilog-auto
- Something that reads the ports, inputs/outputs/interfaces of a module and instantiates them

** DONE verilog-ts-mode: verilog-ts-pretty-declarations and verilog-ts-pretty-expr
CLOSED: [2024-09-27 Fri 17:53]
- Aligns all the declarations: current node, siblings and children
  - That's an issue if in a module declaration, trying to align signals, will also aligh the rest of the code
- Should only align the siblings in a particular range?

** DONE verilog-ts-mode: Group Imenu entries
CLOSED: [2024-09-17 Tue 23:21]
- Imenu entries could be grouped with a tree structure, but with instances inside a module (e.g.)
- Also check the name of external defined methods
- And also the labeling?

* vhdl-ts-mode
** TODO [#A] vhdl-ts-mode: Beautify: rewrite alignment code and make sure it's faster than original one
- Indent code takes more or less the same. The big part comes with alignment.
  - Check if it is possible a much faster tree-sitter implementation
